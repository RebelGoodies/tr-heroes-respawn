## Description

**For those who love heroes!**

### About

Depending on the strength of the hero, most heroes will respawn in around **7 to 30 cycles** when "killed" (including AI).
This can be toggled on and off at any time through buttons in the *Advanced Options* tab (Human and AI can be toggled separately).

- Subsequent deaths by the same hero will increase their respawn time by **10%** each time.
- Any special respawns remain unchanged.
- All Imperial regime heroes will stay, even when progressing through regimes.

### Exceptions to respawn

- Any hero over **120 pop** is excluded, along with Super Star Destroyer (SSD) heroes.
- If a warlord faction gets integrated, their heroes not alive at that moment are gone.

### Recruitable heroes

- Regional and Historical staff heroes are available for the New Republic and Galactic Empire in non-historical modes.
- Imperial players may recruit multiple bounty hunters instead of only one.
- All the random pirates can be hired by the Hutt Cartels and Zsinj's Empire.
- New Republic recruitable commanders follow the same respawn rules.
  When one dies, their slot is effectively suspended until they respawn.
- Extra New Republic staff slots can be purchased for **200 credits** each time.
  Use the blue rebel button that says **"Increase max staff."**
- **Sandbox mode:** Unlock every single New Republic staff option no matter the era, including dead staff and hero squadrons. Cannot be undone.

### Infinities

Heroes spawn at the beginning of Custom GC and FTGU single-planet start games (all players), matching the selected era.
